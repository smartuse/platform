# Smart Use - Land, Growth and Big Data

_[README auf Deutsch](README.de.md)_

A web application for collecting and sharing maps powered by a Geospatial Data Package API. Part of Smart Use, a pilot land use mapping project focusing on the greater metropolitan area around Zurich, Switzerland. The growth of the economy and demographics has until now required the continued expansion of infrastructure and settlement space. The sustainable transformation of urban landscapes can only succeed today, however, when spatial development transitions from a "hardware-oriented" planning of offers, to a "software-oriented" approach in land use management.

Questions about the development of human settlement are answered to a large degree by the tender planning process. Part of a [cooperation program](http://www.metropolitanraum-zuerich.ch/themen/kooperationsprogramm.html), the *[Smart Use](http://smartuse.ch)* project aims to focus settlement development more strongly on the actual behaviour of land users, and therefore with new data sources to better understand their actual demand. The daily routines between home, working and leisure time are to be examined in the entire region, with a focus on the quality and the intensity of use of public spaces, streets and open areas.
